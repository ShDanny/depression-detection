Depression detection from Chinese social media

1. 7002-depression detection-0815 including all codes, such as data processing, models, and feature extraction for user's profile and tweets. While 7002-depression detection-0816, re-training the text CNN model with the database without tokenisation showed little difference from the previous one.
2. This project has four models: rf, mlp, svm and text CNN.  Those four files 7002-rf, 7002-mlp, 7002-svm, and 7002-text CNN used to test the four models separately using part of the tokenized dataset. 
3. 7002-text CNN -no tokenization dataset: same code but no tokenized dataset with 7002-text CNN file.
4. 7002-merge stopwords: used to merge four stop words file.
5. jieba_expanded_dict: used to expand jieba
